# Marionette Fighter — Spike 2 (fingers → strings)

Control physics marionettes with your hands via webcam. **Each fingertip is a string**: five
numbered control points follow your fingers, and each pulls one body part. **Two players, one
camera** — two marionettes stand side by side and each hand drives the puppet on its side. It
answers *can a person puppeteer a hanging physics body with intent, or is it chaos?*

> Evolved past spike-1: the rigid control bar (the "+") and its roll/pitch/yaw posing are **gone**,
> replaced by per-finger string control (the PRD §7 spike-2 increment, pulled forward). A floor was
> added, then a second player. Combat, netcode, and the puppet editor are still out of scope.

**Finger → part map** (fingers 1..5 = thumb..pinky; fingertip landmarks 4/8/12/16/20). The binding
**mirrors per hand by screen side** so neither hand's strings cross. For the hand on the right of
screen (the `FINGERS` / right-hand binding):
`1 thumb→screen-left hand · 2 index→screen-left foot · 3 middle→head · 4 ring→screen-right foot ·
5 pinky→screen-right hand`. The other hand's binding is the left/right mirror (see
[Two players & handedness](#two-players--handedness)). Move your whole hand to move the puppet;
spread/curl fingers to work the limbs. Editable later via the puppet editor (the `FINGERS` array in
`puppet.ts` is that seam).

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

- **Use Chrome.** MediaPipe's GPU delegate is Chrome-only; Safari/Firefox fall back to slower WASM.
- Webcam needs a **secure context** — `http://localhost` qualifies, `file://` does not.
- First load fetches the model + WASM from a CDN, so allow a moment (the `loading…` overlay).

```sh
npm run build      # tsc typecheck + production bundle
npm run typecheck  # types only
```

## Terminology

We use the real marionette vocabulary ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marionette)):

- **control** — the device the puppeteer holds. Spike-1 used a rigid **horizontal control** (the
  cross/"+"); spike-2 drops it: the puppeteer's **fingertips** are the control points directly.
- **strings** — the threads. The British **9-string standard** runs one to each knee, hand and
  shoulder, two to the head, one to the lower back. Our five (head, two hands, two feet) are a
  subset; the puppet editor will let you re-bind fingers to any parts toward the full set.

## What it does

- **Fingers → control points:** MediaPipe Hand Landmarker (VIDEO mode, **2 hands**, GPU) gives 21
  landmarks per hand. Each of the five fingertips (landmarks 4/8/12/16/20) is mapped through stage
  space (`stageX/stageY` in `control.ts` — mirrored x, y-up) to a **kinematic control point**,
  smoothed by its own One Euro filter (each hand keeps its own 5 x/y filters). The full detection
  range maps to the full view, both axes, scaled by the **swing range** slider (`0–1`). Moving your
  whole hand moves all five together; spreading/curling a finger moves that control point alone.
- **One string per finger:** five 10-link **chains**, one from each finger control point to its body
  part (`FINGERS`): `1 thumb→lArm`, `2 index→lLeg`, `3 middle→torso(head)`, `4 ring→rLeg`,
  `5 pinky→rArm`. The torso hangs from the head (middle-finger) string; arms and legs hang off the
  torso (spherical joints) **and** are pulled by their own finger strings — so each limb forms a
  closed loop the foldable chains accommodate. Rendered as smooth curves colour-coded per finger.
  - **Chains, not ropes:** rigid spherical-joint links make each string inextensible (no
    rubberband), but the hinges let it **fold** — it goes slack by draping and never snap-bounces.
    Length = the straight-line span at the rest pose (`STRING_SLACK = 1.0`), so strings are straight
    when the hand is level. The head string spans **51.7% of viewport** (`CENTER_STRING_LEN`).
  - **Stiffness caveat:** a 10-link series chain of light links needs many solver passes
    (`SOLVER_ITERATIONS = 48`) to stay rigid; even so it stretches ~1–2% under normal motion (more
    under an aggressive yank, since the control is One-Euro-smoothed and never teleports). Watch it
    live with the debug overlay.
- **Floor:** a static shelf (`FLOOR_TOP`) near the bottom so a lowered hand rests the puppet
  on-screen instead of dropping it away. Collision groups: puppet parts hit the floor but not each
  other; string segments **also hit the floor** (so the heavy chains pile/drape on it) but still
  **pass through the puppet and through each other** (no joint jitter). Lower your fingers and the
  puppet **crumples onto the floor** (rests cleanly, ~3 mm contact, no burying); raise them and it
  lifts off.
- **Hand overlay:** all 21 landmarks + `HAND_CONNECTIONS` over the camera preview, with the **five
  driving fingertips ringed in their finger colours and numbered 1–5**, matching the on-stage
  control points — so the finger→part mapping reads at a glance.
- **Instrumentation:** fps, hand-LOST indicator, a **swing-range slider** (`0–1` =
  fraction of full-screen reach, default `1.0`), gravity slider,
  a **drag slider** (linear damping / air resistance; low = falls naturally, high =
  floats but settles fast), a **weight slider** (puppet mass multiplier; runtime `setPuppetWeight` rescales each part's
  density — heavier parts keep more tension on the chains, though they also lag more under fast
  yanks), a string-length-% readout, and a **debug: physics lines** checkbox — overlays Rapier's raw
  `world.debugRender()` segments (every chain link + joint) plus each chain's measured summed length
  vs `nominalLen` and live **stretch %** (red past 0.3%), to watch how much the chains actually give.
- **Damping / floatiness:** every dynamic body carries linear + angular damping (`DEFAULT_*_DAMPING`
  in `puppet.ts`). **Linear damping is air resistance** — it caps fall speed at terminal velocity
  ≈ `gravity / linDamp`, so too much makes the puppet *float* down. At gravity 9.8 a screen-height
  fall naturally reaches ~15 u/s, so linear damping is kept low (**0.4**, terminal ~25 → no cap →
  natural fall) and exposed as the **drag slider**; angular damping (fixed `1.0`) settles spin
  without touching the fall. Zero drag = swings forever (the slider's bottom); raising it trades
  natural fall for faster settle. Gravity sets swing *frequency*, not its decay.
- **String friction (chain settle):** the heavy chain segments otherwise wobble in long S-curves and
  take ~20 s to rest. The **string-friction slider** (`DEFAULT_STRING_FRICTION = 8`, `setStringFriction`)
  applies per-segment linear + angular damping — effectively "joint friction" — **decoupled from the
  puppet parts**, so cranking it calms the chains (settle ~5–8 s) *without* re-floating the fall. Low =
  floppy, high = stiff but the strings start to lag the control (sluggish). The drag slider now affects
  only the puppet parts; this one only the string segments.

## Two players & handedness

Two marionettes share one world and one floor, spawned side by side at `±PUPPET_X_OFFSET` (`3`). Each
hand drives the puppet on its side. The split is clean:

- **Screen side picks the puppet.** Each frame the (up to two) detected hands are ordered by **wrist
  screen-x**: the further-screen-left wrist drives the **left** puppet, the other drives the **right**
  puppet. With one hand, it drives the puppet on its half (left/right of centre); with none, both
  puppets just **hang** (their kinematic controls hold their last position). Filters stay tied to a
  screen side, so smoothing is continuous as long as each player stays on their half. Motion is **not
  clamped** (foul lines are a later, in-game rule).
- **Handedness picks the binding mirror (so strings never cross).** In the selfie-mirrored view a
  **right** hand's thumb sits screen-**left**, so the right-hand binding (`FINGERS`) sends the thumb to
  a screen-left part and the pinky to a screen-right part — nothing crosses. A **left** hand is the
  L↔R mirror (`LEFT_HAND_BINDING = mirrorBinding(FINGERS)`: swap each part's left/right side, head
  stays, same landmark order). Each control is driven **by its target part**, so whichever hand lands
  on a puppet, the screen-left fingertip always pulls a screen-left part.

  | hand | binding (thumb→ … →pinky) |
  |---|---|
  | right-hand (`FINGERS`) | thumb→L.hand, index→L.foot, middle→head, ring→R.foot, pinky→R.hand |
  | left-hand (mirror) | thumb→R.hand, index→R.foot, middle→head, ring→L.foot, pinky→L.hand |

- **⚠ The selfie-mirror flip — `HANDEDNESS_LABEL_IS_MIRRORED` in `puppet.ts`.** MediaPipe reports
  handedness (`categoryName` "Left"/"Right") from the **unmirrored** camera image, but our preview and
  stage are **selfie-mirrored**, so the label as the user sees it is usually flipped (a physically
  right hand is labelled "Left"). The constant defaults to **`true`** (invert the label before picking
  the binding) — the best guess for a mirrored view, but **unverified on a live webcam**. If on camera
  the two hands come out with **crossed strings**, flip `HANDEDNESS_LABEL_IS_MIRRORED` to `false`.

## Architecture

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/main.ts` | Loop: physics steps every frame; `detectForVideo` only on new camera frames. Assigns the two hands to the two puppets by wrist screen-x, picks each hand's binding from handedness, drives each puppet's controls **by target part** (per-hand One Euro filters), and owns the sliders. |
| `src/control.ts` | **Dependency-free** `stageX`/`stageY` (landmark → mirrored, y-up stage space). No MediaPipe import. |
| `src/puppet.ts` | Rapier rig, split **world + puppet**: `buildWorld` makes the shared world + floor; `addPuppet(world, xOffset, binding)` adds one puppet (5 controls + 5 chain strings + torso/limbs). The `FINGERS` binding, its `mirrorBinding` L↔R helper, the `HANDEDNESS_LABEL_IS_MIRRORED` flip, and all rig constants live here. |
| `src/hands.ts` | MediaPipe init (CDN WASM + model, **`numHands: 2`**) and `HAND_CONNECTIONS`. |
| `src/draw.ts` | 2D-canvas renderer (`clear()` + per-puppet `drawPuppet()`, adaptive scale, finger-coloured strings + control points) + both-hands landmark overlay (`drawHands`) + physics-debug overlay. |
| `src/oneEuro.ts` | One Euro filter, ported verbatim from the validated dot test. |
| `puppet-spike-1.html` | Original single-file spike, kept for reference. |

**2.5D plane lock:** every dynamic body uses `enabledTranslations(true,true,false)` +
`enabledRotations(false,false,true)`, so it stays on the z=0 plane. The control points are kinematic
(driven directly). Verified headlessly on the **two-puppet** world (100 chain segments + 2 sets of
closed loops): driving both puppets' controls through an aggressive sweep+spread keeps
`max |z| == 0`, `max |coord| ≈ 9.94` (no explosion), no NaN, and lowering both hands crumples each
puppet to rest cleanly on the shared floor (lowest point ≈ `0.797` vs `FLOOR_TOP 0.8` — ~3 mm
contact). The mirrored binding geometry is also asserted: ordering each hand's fingers left→right by
screen position yields part sides `[-1,-1,0,1,1]` (non-decreasing) for **both** hands — no crossing.

## Tuning knobs (in `src/puppet.ts`)

- `FINGERS` — the finger→part bindings as data rows (`name`, `landmark`, `target` body, `bodyAnchor`).
  This is the seam for the puppet editor: re-point any finger at any part (`torso`/`lArm`/`rArm`/
  `lLeg`/`rLeg`). Each row becomes one kinematic control point + a chain string.
- `SEG_COUNT` (`10`) / `SEG_RAD` / `SEG_DENSITY` (`2.0`) — links per string, and how thin/heavy they
  are. More links fold finer but stretch more. `SEG_DENSITY` `2.0` makes the strings read as **heavy
  chains** (each string ≈ `0.08` total mass) while staying **below the lightest limb it pulls** at the
  default `4×` weight (arm ≈ `0.17`), so the puppet drives the strings, not the reverse. Heavier links
  also *improve* the link↔puppet mass ratio, so stretch went **down** (≈ `6.8% → 5.6%` under the same
  hard sweep). Caveat: the weight slider goes as low as `1×`, where the arm (≈ `0.04`) drops under the
  string mass and wagging can creep in — the constant is sized for the `4×` default on purpose.
- `SOLVER_ITERATIONS` (`48`) — a 10-link series chain of light links needs many passes to stay rigid
  (and the 5-string rig adds closed loops). 48 holds ~1–2% stretch at normal speed; it plateaus past
  ~48 (residual is series-compliance, not iteration count).
- `STRING_SLACK` (`1.0`) — chain length = `restDist * slack`. `1.0` = exactly the straight-line span,
  so strings are straight at the rest pose; `>1` adds fold room.
- `DEFAULT_LINEAR_DAMPING` (`0.4`, the **drag** slider) / `DEFAULT_ANGULAR_DAMPING` (`1.0`, fixed) —
  linear damping is air resistance and caps fall speed (`terminal ≈ gravity/linDamp`); kept low so
  the puppet falls naturally. Angular settles spin without touching the fall.
- `DEFAULT_PUPPET_WEIGHT` (`4`, the **weight** slider) — part mass multiplier (`setPuppetWeight`,
  applied to **both** puppets).
- `PUPPET_X_OFFSET` (`3`) — the two puppets spawn at `±` this x. `HANDEDNESS_LABEL_IS_MIRRORED`
  (`true`) — the selfie-mirror flip for the handedness label (see [Two players & handedness](#two-players--handedness); flip if strings cross on a live webcam).
- `WORLD_VIEW_HEIGHT`, `CONTROL_BASE_Y`, `CENTER_STRING_LEN`, `FLOOR_TOP` — rig geometry / floor height.

Control-path tunables in `src/main.ts`:

- `swingRange` (the **swing range** slider, `0–1`) — scales each fingertip's mapped position; `1.0`
  = full screen. `VERT_CENTER` / `VERT_SPAN` set the vertical band (full `[0,12]`).
- `POS_MIN_CUTOFF` (`5.0`) / `POS_BETA` — per-finger One Euro smoothing. The raw landmark overlay has
  no perceptible lag, so little smoothing is needed; higher = snappier, lower = steadier.

## Notes for the next pass

- **Puppet editor:** the `FINGERS` array is the data seam — an in-app binding picker is the next step.
- **Render:** still 2D canvas (PRD §4.4 permits it). Three.js migration deferred; `three` is not a dep.
- The Rapier API was version-checked against the installed `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat@0.19.3`.
- The verdict on "legible enough to act with intent" is **Scott's hand judgment** (PRD §6).
